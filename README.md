# Fusion Frontend

## Overview
This Project is the frontend of the Fusion - IIITDMJ's ERP Portal. We've migrated the frontend of fusion from Django templates to a modern React-based architecture.

## ## Tech Stack

- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/learn) as the main frontend library
- [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/getting-started/) for UI components
- [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) for state management
- [Phosphor-icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) for icons

Check the `package.json` file for more information about all the libraries being used.
This project is using Eslint and Prettier for linting and formatting the code.

## Setting up the project 🛠️

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone **your forked** repository
3. Change directory to the project folder(`cd path/to/project`)
4. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
   The development server will start at `http://localhost:5173/`

Make sure that your backend server is running properly before starting the frontend server.

- Note: You can access the username and role of the user using the `useSelector` hook.

```jsx
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const role = useSelector(state => state.user.role);
  const username = useSelector(state => state.user.username);
  return (
    <div>
      {username}
      {role}
    </div>
  );
}
